# Echofon Unofficial

Maintained version of Echofon: full featured, super clean Twitter app for Firefox.

This is based on JaHIY [JaHIY](https://github.com/JaHIY) [changes](https://gist.github.com/JaHIY/4483939) and a follow up to fix support for Firefox 36 and ongoing.

Use build.sh to zip Echofon.jar and produce the xpi.

**You can [download the add-on here](/../../releases).**
